# CSE 330 Creative Project

## Project Descriptions

I got an old idea from last semester. I was taking chem lab last year, on the last day of help session, I got a sticker saying that chem experiments are like cooking (but do not lick the spoon). So I wonder if we can make a scientific cuisine sharing websites using precise measurements to help us cooks better.
